# üöÄ RFM Customer Segmentation Project with SQL & Power BI  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **end-to-end customer segmentation** using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model**.  
The goal is to analyze customer purchase behavior, identify key customer groups (like **Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, etc.**) and visualize insights in **Power BI** for better business decisions.  

---

## üõ† Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** ‚Äì Bulk insert sales data into SQL database  
- **MySQL (SQL)** ‚Äì Data preprocessing & RFM calculation  
- **Power BI** ‚Äì Interactive dashboards & visualizations

## üìÇ Workflow  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Insertion with Python**  
- Bulk inserted sample sales dataset into MySQL database.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **SQL RFM Segmentation**  
- Converted `ORDERDATE` into proper date format.  
- Calculated **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values** for each customer.  
- Applied `NTILE(5)` window functions to generate **R, F, M scores (1‚Äì5 scale)**.  
- Combined into **RFM Combination Codes** (e.g., 555, 454, 332).  
- Segmented customers into groups:  
  - Champions  
  - Loyal Customers  
  - Promising Customers  
  - About to Sleep  
  - At Risk  
  - Other
